##Content Summary##

#####Body#####

1. An ALARM FROM The Holy Mountain of the Lord to the Inhabitants of the EARTH, AND The word of the Lord ſounding out of Sion, let all the Inhabitants tremble. With a Warning to the wicked, calling them to Repentance.

1. Pro. 29. and 19.Where there is no Viſion the people periſh; And thus ſaith the LordJoel 2. and 28.I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall Propheſy, and your Old men ſhall dream dreams, and your Young men ſhall ſee Viſions.

1. A Copy of this following Letter in obedience to the Lord was written, and delivered into the hand of Richard Brown, (who is Commander over the Trained-B•nds, and Souldiers of the City of London;) but before he either read it or lookt into it he put it into the fire with his own hand, by which it was burnt, Mary Cooper the barer thereof being preſent, the Lord who moved to write and ſend it unto him, hath commanded to Print it, that yet he and others may come to ſee what that ſpirit that rules in him would ſtif•le and burn.

1. By reaſon of our cruel cloſe impriſoment, where we are thronged in naſty holes through thy means, divers of our friends have fallen ſick, and one of them is departed this life, which thou mayeſt feell the burden and weight off, when God accounts the death of his Martyres upon his perſecutors.
